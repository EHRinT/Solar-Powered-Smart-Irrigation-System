# Solar-Powered-Smart-Irrigation-System
A smart irrigation system that leverages on Internet of Things (IoT) and smartphone technologies to monitor and control the irrigation system. The system consist of two operation system, which are automatic and manual operation. The automatic operation will allows the irrigation system to operate based on the soil mositure sensor, while the manual operation is controlled by the mobile application that allows user to control the system manually. Solar energy is used as a power source for this project.
